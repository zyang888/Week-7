# Week 7

This week is an exercise in sever-side rendering with Express. 

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this week, a student should:
- have implemented a simple server-side rendered front end
- use a database to determine the content of the rendered HTML 

## The assignment

The assignment this week is designed to get you to build a very simple server-side rendered project. You will build a simple weather app that takes in a location name from a user and then displays a page with the temperature for that location, if available.

### Getting started

1. Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer. I am using Node v12.16, but anything above 12 will be fine.
2. Ensure you have git and github set up on your computer. If you do not, please follow this guide: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github.
3. Fork this repository and clone it locally. 
4. In your terminal, from inside this project directory, run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
5. Download and install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). This project uses the default MongoDB configuration. If you run Mongo in a non-standard way you may need to update the configuration in `index.js` to match. If you have issues, reference the [Mongoose Connection Guide](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html).
6. Run `npm start` to start your local server. You should see a logged statement telling you `Server is listening on http://localhost:5000`.
7. Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or an API client of your choice. Browse the various endpoints contained in this project. Practice calling all of them and getting 200 HTTP responses.
8. Run the unit tests of this project: `npm test`. Your test output should end in something like this:
```
Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 passed, 2 total
Tests:       8 failed, 52 passed, 60 total
```

### Your Task

We are building a very simple weather application, complete with front end interactions. Here are the routes you will need:

- Landing
  - Hello World: `GET /landing/` - a simple Hello, World page
- Weather
  - Landing: `GET /weather` - get a web page that allows you to enter a location name in a form for submission
  - Location: `GET /weather/location?name=<location name>` - get the temperature for a provided location using a `weather` mongo collection.

There is a `Weather` model provided. Please use it to get temperature data. You do not need to create a way to populate this collection, but you may want to create records manually.
  
Tests for these routes are in place but failing. Your task is to write the additional route, DAO, and model code that will get these tests passing. Doing so will require the use of the [mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) library for building HTML from templates. 

Once all the provided tests are passing then you should know your code is correct. You should not make any changes to the test files.


### Grading

Component | Points
--------- | --------
All tests, as originally given, are passing | 30
Clear, organized project structure | 20
**Total** | 50

### Submission

- Create a pull request (PR) from your repository to the master branch of this repository. Make your name the title of the PR. 
- Continuous Integration is handled using Github Actions. This will automatically run your tests and show the results on your PR. If you see a red X and a message saying `All checks have failed` then you will not receive full credit. Ensure all tests are passing in order to receive full marks.
